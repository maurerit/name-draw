# Implementation Plan: Name Draw Application with Social Login

**Branch**: `001-create-an-application` | **Date**: September 8, 2025 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/home/maurerit/Projects/specs/name-draw/specs/001-create-an-application/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → Feature spec loaded successfully ✓
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Java Spring Boot backend + React + Vite frontend (web application)
   → Set Structure Decision: Option 2 (Web application)
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → Initial constitution check passed ✓
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → All technical context clarified, no unknowns remaining
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → Post-design constitution check ✓
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Primary requirement: Social login-enabled name draw application where users can create draws, join draws, and perform random name drawing with persistent results. Technical approach: Java Spring Boot backend with React + Vite frontend, OAuth integration for Facebook/Google authentication, H2 database for data persistence, and in-memory queue management for high-performance concurrent draw operations.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Java 17+ (Spring Boot 3.x), TypeScript/JavaScript (React 18+, Vite 4+)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Spring Boot, Spring Security OAuth2, Spring Data JPA, React, Vite, Docker  
**Storage**: H2 database for main data, In-memory storage for draw queue (high-performance transactional operations)  
**Testing**: JUnit 5 + Testcontainers (backend), Jest + React Testing Library (frontend)  
**Target Platform**: Containerized deployment (Docker), Web browsers (modern ES6+ support)
**Project Type**: Web application (backend + frontend)  
**Performance Goals**: <200ms API response time, support concurrent draws, <100MB memory for queue operations  
**Constraints**: OAuth-only authentication, atomic draw operations, prevent concurrent name draws  
**Scale/Scope**: Family-sized groups (max 30 participants per draw), multiple concurrent draws supported

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 2 (backend API, frontend web app) ✓
- Using framework directly? Yes - Spring Boot, React ✓
- Single data model? Yes - shared entities between backend/frontend ✓
- Avoiding patterns? Using JPA repositories (proven need for data access) ✓

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? Backend services as libraries, frontend components as modules ✓
- Libraries listed: 
  - auth-service (OAuth integration)
  - draw-service (draw lifecycle management)
  - queue-service (concurrent draw management)
  - user-service (participant management)
- CLI per library: Spring Boot Actuator endpoints with management features ✓
- Library docs: OpenAPI documentation planned ✓

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? Yes - tests written first ✓
- Git commits show tests before implementation? Enforced by process ✓
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? Yes ✓
- Real dependencies used? H2 (as documented in research.md), actual OAuth providers for integration ✓
- Integration tests for: OAuth flows, draw operations, queue management ✓
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase ✓

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? Spring Boot logging with JSON format ✓
- Frontend logs → backend? Error reporting service integration ✓
- Error context sufficient? Request tracing, user context, operation context ✓

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? 1.0.0 (MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD) ✓
- BUILD increments on every change? CI/CD pipeline enforced ✓
- Breaking changes handled? API versioning, database migrations ✓

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) - Backend API + Frontend SPA with Docker containerization

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

All technical context has been clarified based on user requirements:

1. **Technology Stack Decisions**:
   - Backend: Java Spring Boot (constitutional requirement)
   - Frontend: React + Vite (constitutional requirement)
   - Authentication: OAuth2 with Facebook/Google providers
   - Database: H2 for persistence
   - Queue: In-memory for high-performance draw operations
   - Containerization: Docker for deployment

2. **Architecture Decisions**:
   - RESTful API design for backend
   - JWT tokens for session management
   - Optimistic locking for draw queue operations
   - State-based draw lifecycle management

3. **Performance Decisions**:
   - In-memory queue table for atomic draw operations
   - Connection pooling for database access
   - Caching for user profile data

**Output**: research.md with consolidated technology and architecture decisions
└── [same as backend above]

ios/ or android/
└── [platform-specific structure]
```

**Structure Decision**: [DEFAULT to Option 1 unless Technical Context indicates web/mobile app]

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - User (OAuth profile, name, provider info)
   - Draw (state, creator, draw date, participant count)
   - Participation (user-draw relationship, join timestamp)
   - DrawnName (participant, drawn name, draw timestamp)
   - DrawQueue (draw ID primary key for atomic operations)

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - Authentication endpoints (OAuth callback, token refresh)
   - Draw management (create, join, transition states, view)
   - Drawing operations (perform draw, view results)
   - User management (profile, draw history)
   - Output OpenAPI 3.0 schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - Authentication flow tests
   - Draw lifecycle tests
   - Concurrent drawing tests
   - Edge case tests (self-draws, queue management)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Draw creator flow scenarios
   - Participant flow scenarios
   - Non-participant viewing scenarios
   - Edge case scenarios

5. **Update agent file incrementally**:
   - Spring Boot + React + Docker context
   - OAuth integration patterns
   - JPA + H2 setup
   - Testing with Testcontainers

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, .github/copilot-instructions.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs
- Backend setup tasks (Spring Boot project, dependencies, Docker)
- Frontend setup tasks (React + Vite project, dependencies, Docker)
- Database tasks (schema, migrations, Testcontainers setup)
- Authentication tasks (OAuth configuration, JWT handling)
- Core feature tasks (draw lifecycle, queue management, user flows)
- Testing tasks (contract, integration, unit tests)
- Integration tasks (API-frontend integration, Docker compose)

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Infrastructure first: Database, Docker setup
- Authentication second: OAuth flows, user management
- Core features third: Draw operations, queue management
- Integration fourth: Frontend-backend integration
- Testing throughout: Each feature with tests first (TDD)
- Mark [P] for parallel execution where possible

**Estimated Output**: 30-35 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional violations requiring justification*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| N/A | N/A | N/A |

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [x] Complexity deviations documented

---
*Based on Constitution v1.0.0 - See `/memory/constitution.md`*
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `/scripts/update-agent-context.sh [claude|gemini|copilot]` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
